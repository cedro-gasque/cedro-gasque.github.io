# Driving Question:

## Can you visualize the idea of "power creep" in Magic: the Gathering?

There is always this pervasive idea of "power creep" in games like Magic: the Gathering.

The idea that the power level of game elements increase over time as the creators have to
create new elements that can outcompete old game elements in order to sell their newer product.
